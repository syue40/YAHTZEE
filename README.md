# YAHTZEE
A text-based YAHTZEE game I made for a project in my first term Python class. 

This is the first official game I made for my Intro to Python programming class.
It's an entirely text based YAHTZEE game!

The code is messy and relies mostly on if/else statements to run the game loop. The game essentially consists of many checks of whether scores have been filled or if they are valid. These functions are all controlled by a controller which adds and subtracts from a count to determine which player's turn it is.
